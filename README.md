# What is Codewars? 
Codewars is an educational community for computer programming. The platform provides programming challenges known as kata which trains a range of skills in a variety of programming languages all completed within an online IDE with gamification elements. 

In this repo, I store my completed solutions as portfolio.

In Codewars, we solve real code challenges to improve our ranks. Kata ranks are determined based on its subject area and difficulty. Completing these katas advance our ranks.
